In this game, Jack, Queen, and King are each worth 10 and the Ace is worth 1 or 11.\n\nThe dealer will first ask you to hit (take another card) or stay. As long as you don't bust, once you decide to stay, the dealer will then play his hand. The dealer always has to hit until his hand is at least 17. Whoever has the better hand at the end wins!\n\nPress Enter to start playing.\n")
